# ShintoMon.Unity.3D
Shinto Mon is a simple game written in C# with Unity. It takes much influence from the shrine gate that stands near the shore of Lake Biwa in Shiga Prefecture, Japan. The game is based on classic breakout games of the 80's, you must grant all the wishes by collecting all the ema with bouncing orbs. Ema are wishes written by ordinary people on wooden (and sometimes gold) tablets at Shinto and Buddhist shrines all over Japan. The game environment attempts to provide a calming atmosphere and gaming experience, moving away from the challenging and exciting spectrum. The goal was not to make the game-play very difficult, although some levels will be quite challenging, but instead to provide calming and hopefully enjoyable game-play in short stints. [Unity, C#]
